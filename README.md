# Continuous nDTW Playground

The scripts in this repo define a continuous nDTW function based on
sampling uniformly from each trajectory to the specified number of points by
linearly interpolating each segment. 

A matplotlib playground is built to explore how nDTW changes with different paths.

# General Usage
* Use `tab` to toggle from red/blue points
* Use `c` to clear all points
* Use `enter` to show interpolation
